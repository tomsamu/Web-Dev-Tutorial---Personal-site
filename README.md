# Web-Dev-Tutorial---Personal-site
Tutorial project for creating a personal website.

Unfinished version. To do:
* Images in the skills section (chili and computer image) should not expand endlessly. Some kind of max-width needs to be implemented.
* Reduce the margins somewhat of the mountain image and clouds above the fold.
* Add a max-width for the entire page, like placing the page in a centered container of 1024px.

Above will probably never get done since its just a tutorial project. But still good to have notes for future me.
